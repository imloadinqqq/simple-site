				<h3>New York Knicks Lose Game 5 at Home</h3><br>
				<p>Alex Diaz / April 30, 2025</p>
				<p>Last night, the New York Knicks lost to the Detroit Pistons 106-103.
					Both teams came out aggressive, but also inefficient with both teams shooting 40% in the first half.
					The game ended with a clutch shot by OG Anunoby to cut the lead to 1, but it was too late as they had to play
					the foul game against the Pistons.
					Despite this, the Knicks still lead the series 3-2 and will go back to Detroit for Game 6 on Thursday.<br><br>
					<b>Good luck to my Knicks!!!</b>

				<p>Alex Diaz / May 1, 2025</p>
				<p>The New York Knicks advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals after defeating the Detroit Pistons
					116-113.
					Jalen Brunson lead the way scoring 40 points with a clutch 3 pointer with 4 seconds remaining in the 4th

				<h3>New York Knicks Take Game 1 Against Boston Celtics</h3><br>
				<p>Alex Diaz / May 6, 2025</p>
				<p>Last night, the Knicks defeated the Celtics in a Game 1 thriller. After a tight first half, the Celtics
					pulled ahead by 20 in the third quarter. The Knicks rallied together to come back in this game, tying the game
					in the fourth quarter. Brunson had a chance to end the game, but missed the layup. Overtime was pure hustle by
					the Knicks, effort play after effort play. One play that stands out is the Mikal Bridges steal, to Josh Hart,
					to a cutting OG dunk and one. Towns underperformed, but had a big tip-in during the final minutes. The game
					ended with a Boston inbound play with 3 seconds left, where Mikal Bridges snatched the ball right out of Jalen
					Brown's hands.<br>Brunson and OG lead the way with 29 points a piece. Boston shot 60 three pointers in this
					game and set a new post season record for most missed three pointers in a playoff game with 45 missed!<br>Game
					2 will be back at TD Garden tomorrow.<br><br>
					<b>Let's go Knicks!!!</b>

				<h3>New York Knicks Steal Game 2 Against Boston Celtics</h3><br>
				<p>Alex Diaz / May 8, 2025</p>
				<p>The New York Knicks have done it again! Down 20 AGAIN near the end of the 3rd, the Knicks rallied through
					tough
					defense and some timely buckets to win this game.<br>Josh Hart was tonight's leading scorer for the Knicks
					with 23. Mikal Bridges, who had stuggled the first three quarters, scored all of his 14 points in the 4th
					quarter.<br>Great win for the Knicks, the series will continue on Saturday May 10th in New York.<br><br>
